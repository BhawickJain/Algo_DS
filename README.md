A repo for my own Algorithm and Data Structures learning and code. It includes problems, algorithms and their notes to capture learnings.

## TODO
`[x]` Setup Jupyter Notebooks with Docker  
`[x]` Write Linear Search Algorithm  
`[x]` Write Binary Search Algorithm in Iteration format  
`[x]` Write Binary Search Algorithm in Recursion format  
`[x]` Write up a discussion of the arrays data structure in python; how it works and what methods it offers.  
`[x]` Present a little bit of a comparison of how other languages would handle arrays and the time-space complexities to consider.  
`[x]` Create a Linked-List data structure and give it some features  
`[?]` Why does Python call Arrays as Lists?

A repo for my own Algorithm and Data Structures learning and code. It includes problems, algorithms and their notes to capture learnings.

## TODO
`[x]` Setup Jupyter Notebooks with Docker  
`[x]` Write Linear Search Algorithm  
`[x]` Write Binary Search Algorithm in Iteration format  
`[x]` Write Binary Search Algorithm in Recursion format
